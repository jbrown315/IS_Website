<h2>What is a Perceptron?</h2>

    <h2 class="subTitles">A Perceptron is the simplest form of an Artifical Neural Network, and the first type of ANN that was ever created.</h2>

    <div class="generalText"><p>A Perceptron is an Artificial Neural Network that only has an input layer and an output
                                layer, however no hidden layer.<br><br>

                                Being a much simpler form of an ANN, Perceptrons are generally used to carry out
                                "and/or" logic gate problems. "and/or" logic gates are a commonly used in all forms
                                of programming. The logic gates are formatted as "x and y"/"x or y" where x and y
                                are each statements which will return a true or a false. For "and", both statements
                                must return true, for "or" at least one of the statements must return true.

    <div class="generalText"><p> A key piece of every Neural Network are the weights. In a Perceptron, the weights are randomly
                                 to each of the given inputs. When you run the code, the weights will be constantly adjusted
                                 through a method called Backpropagation. <br><br>

                                 Backpropagation simply compares the actual output to the expected output and then adjusts
                                 the weights accordingly.<br><br>

                                 On the following page, you will see a Perceptron model that I originally coded in python by
                                 by following a tutorial. However, in the making of the website, I had to translate the script
                                 into JavaScript.<br><br>
