<h2>What is a Perceptron?</h2>

    <h2 class="subTitles">A Perceptron is the simplest form of an Artifical Neural Network, and the first type of ANN that was ever created.</h2>

    <div class="generalText"><p>A Perceptron is an Artificial Neural Network that only has an input layer and an output
                                layer, however no hidden layer.<br><br>

                                Being a much simpler form of an ANN, Perceptrons are generally used to carry out
                                "and/or" logic gate problems. "and/or" logic gates are a commonly used in all forms
                                of programming. The logic gates are formatted as "x and y"/"x or y" where x and y
                                are each statements which will return a true or a false. For "and", both statements
                                must return true, for "or" at least one of the statements must return true.

    <h2 class="subTitles">How does a Perceptron work?</h2>
    <img id="PFlowchart" src="photos\PFlowchart.png" alt="Diagram of artificial neural network">
    <p class="figures">Figure 2.</p>
    <div class="generalText"><p> Pratik Shukla and Roberto Iriondo from TowardsAI defined an artificial neural network (ANN) as
                                 "interconnected input and output units in which each connection has an associated weight." <br><br>

                                 But what does that mean? To help understand how these processes are conducted, we can look at a
                                 common real world example:<br><br>

                                 Lets say you are in your house and the fire alarm goes off. You only have a limited amount of time
                                 to evacuate, so what will you grab on your way out? <br><br>

                                 Family, Pets, Jewelry and Money are a few of the possible options here. Most people would immediately
                                 go after their family and pets. In the context of an ANN, Family and Pets would have a larger weight
                                 value and Jewelry and Money would have a lower weight value.
